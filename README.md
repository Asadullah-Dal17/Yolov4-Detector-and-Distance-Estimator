# Yolov4-Detector-and-Distance-Estimator

*Find distance from object to camera using YoloV4 object detector, here we will be using single camera :camera:, detailed explanation of distance estimation is available another repository* [**Face detection and Distance Estimation using single camera**](https://github.com/Asadullah-Dal17/Distance_measurement_using_single_camera)

### [Video Tutorial Explains the concept and implementation ](https://youtu.be/FcRCwTgYXJw)

- Here we are targeting the person and cell phone classes only, for demo purpose.

- you can follow all the steps mentioned in the video to create for other objects as well. (not-published yet)

implementation detail available on [_**Darknet**_](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet)

## TO DO

- [x] Finding distance of mutiple object at same time.

## Installation you need opencv-contrib-python

[opencv contrib](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-contrib-python/)

--> **windows**

`pip install opencv-contrib-python`

--> **Linux or Mac**

`pip3 install opencv-contrib-python`

then just clone this repository and you are good to go.

I have use tiny weights, check out more on darknet github for more

I have ![YouTube Channel Subscribers](https://img.shields.io/youtube/channel/subscribers/UCc8Lx22a5OX4XMxrCykzjbA?style=social), If you can increase that counter, go a head do this for me ðŸ˜ƒ, just kidding as always ;-)  [AiPhle](https://youtube.come/c/aiphle) is all about Computer Vision, AI and Electronics.

hope you found this helpful,  if you want to ask me any thing then.
